\textit{Currency exchange matrix.} We consider a set of $n$ currencies, labeled
$1, \cdots, n$. (These might correspond to USD, RMB, EUR, and so on.) At a
particular time the exchange or conversion rates among the $n$ currencies are
given by an $n \times n$ (exchange rate) matrix $R$, where $R_{ij}$ is the
amount of currency $i$ that you can buy for one unit of currency $j$. (All
entries of $R$ are positive.) The exchange rates include commission charges, so
we have $R_{ji}R_{ij} < 1$ for all $i \neq j$. You can assume that $R_{ii} = 1$.

\par Suppose $y = Rx$, where $x$ is a vector (with nonnegative entries) that
represents the amounts of the currencies that we hold. What is $y_i$? Your
answer should be in English.

% SOLUTION
\par \textbf{Solution:}
\par $y_i$ is the total amount of currency $i$ that we can exchange for by converting
all the currencies that we hold. Multiplying $Rx$, we have:
$$ y_i = \sum_{j=1}^n R_{ij}x_j $$
Here, $x_j$ represents our holdings of currency $j$, and $R_{ij}$ represents
represents the exchange rate from currency $j$ to currency $i$. Thus,
multiplying these two values together gives us the amount of currency $i$ that
we can exchange for. Summing over all $n$ currencies gives us the total amount
of currency $i$ that we can exchange for.
